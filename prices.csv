BALAYAGE | OMBRE
For individual and natural color gradients, the balayage technique is applied freehand by the colorist. There are transitions of varying strength and intensity. This creates a soft and natural effect. This technique is suitable for both bleaching and coloration. Can be combined with a highlight technique (foilayage) depending on the desired intensity. Advantage: natural-looking regrowth & lower maintenance.

                                                        Welcome to our beauty oasis, Vivali Beauty Boutique
                                                    

                                                        If someone were to ask me, what does beauty mean to me, I would reply that beauty is discipline.
                                                    

                                                        Since my childhood, I have understood the importance of taking care of your body and face. It is essential to me because I believe that everything in our lives begins with self-discipline and self-respect. Innately, I entered the beauty business.
                                                    






                                                            About Vivali

                                                        Welcome to our beauty oasis, Vivali Beauty Boutique
                                                    

                                                        If someone were to ask me, what does beauty mean to me, I would reply that beauty is discipline.
                                                    

                                                        Since my childhood, I have understood the importance of taking care of your body and face. It is essential to me because I believe that everything in our lives begins with self-discipline and self-respect. Innately, I entered the beauty business.

                                                        Welcome to our beauty oasis, Vivali Beauty Boutique
                                                    

                                                        If someone were to ask me, what does beauty mean to me, I would reply that beauty is discipline.
                                                    

                                                        Since my childhood, I have understood the importance of taking care of your body and face. It is essential to me because I believe that everything in our lives begins with self-discipline and self-respect. Innately, I entered the beauty business.

                                                        Welcome to our beauty oasis, Vivali Beauty Boutique
                                                    

                                                        If someone were to ask me, what does beauty mean to me, I would reply that beauty is discipline.
                                                    

                                                        Since my childhood, I have understood the importance of taking care of your body and face. It is essential to me because I believe that everything in our lives begins with self-discipline and self-respect. Innately, I entered the beauty business.

                                                        Welcome to our beauty oasis, Vivali Beauty Boutique
                                                    

                                                        If someone were to ask me, what does beauty mean to me, I would reply that beauty is discipline.
                                                    

                                                        Since my childhood, I have understood the importance of taking care of your body and face. It is essential to me because I believe that everything in our lives begins with self-discipline and self-respect. Innately, I entered the beauty business.
